How to use Plant Conditions

1. Run the code by either pushing run or typing "PlantConditions" into the
command window.

2. Step 1 : When the UI pop's up, you can select the month in which you plan
to plant your tree using the scroll bar.

3. If you selected a month that is good to plant in, then it will let you
know that the time is right, and for you to move onto the next check (Step 2).
If the month you selected was not ideal for your tree then it will tell you
to pick a different month.

4. Step 2 : After picking the right month, you must now pick the correct zone.
Use the radio buttons for this step.

5. Every plant has a hardiness zone rating which dictates what parts of the
country it can survive in. By picking the right zone, the UI will let you
know that you're good to go and can plant your tree. Nebraska is zones 5-6, 
so anything other than zones 5 and 6, the UI will tell you that the enviornment
is not the best for your plant and to choose a different zone.

6. After the UI says to go ahead and plant the tree, you are done.
